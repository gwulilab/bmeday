                William E. Bentley is the Robert E. Fischell Distinguished Chair of Engineering and the Inaugural Director of the Robert E. Fischell Institute for Biomedical Devices. He is also appointed to the Department of
                Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park and the Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research. At Maryland since 1989, Dr. Bentley has focused his research on 
                the development of molecular tools that facilitate the expression of biologically active proteins, having authored over 300 related archival publications. He is a fellow of AAAS, ACS, AIMBE, and the American 
                Academy of Microbiology. He has served on advisory committees for the NIH, NSF, DOD, DOE, FDA, USDA, and several state agencies and has mentored over 40 PhDs and 25 postdocs, many now in leadership roles within 
                industry (24), federal agencies (5) and academia (26). He co-founded a protein manufacturing company, Chesapeake PERL, based on insect larvae as mini bioreactors.

              <p>
                  Michael Buschmann received a B. Engineering Physics from the University of Saskatchewan in 1984, and a Ph.D. in Medical Engineering and Medical Physics from MIT and Harvard University in 1992, and postdoctoral 
                  training from the University of Bern, Switzerland from 1992-1994. From 1994 to July 2017, Dr. Buschmann was Professor of Biomedical Engineering and Chemical Engineering at Polytechnique de Montréal. As of Aug 1, 
                  2017 he is Chair of the Department of Bioengineering in the Volgenau School of Engineering at George Mason University in Fairfax Virginia, USA. He developed novel methods and instrumentation for biomechanical 
                  testing of tissues that were translated into commercialized instruments by Biomomentum Inc. Subsequently Dr. Buschmann led a multifaceted research program in biomaterials for tissue regeneration that resulted in 
                  successful clinical translation of a cartilage repair product that is marketed internationally by Smith and Nephew. At his new lab, he is focusing on new technologies to deliver messenger RNA for vaccines and for 
                  protein replacement therapies. Dr. Buschmann has over 150 peer-reviewed manuscripts, 20 patent applications (9 granted), an H-index over 60, won 19 research prizes, and founded 3 successful biomedical companies.

                  Dr. Rong Li is the Chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine & Health Sciences. He did his PhD thesis work at the University of 
                  California Berkeley and received his postdoctoral training at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Prior to his current faculty position at GWU, he was on the faculty of the University of Virginia School of 
                  Medicine from 1996-2006 and the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio from 2007-2018. As the co-leader of the scientific programs at the NCI-designated Cancer Centers of these two 
                  institutions, Dr. Li played an active role in multiple successful competitive renewals of the NCI designation.
